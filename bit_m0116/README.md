Picture this... It's 1987, and you're an engineer tasked with the crucial job of designing a legendary keyboard for Apple's upcoming **Macintosh SE**. How would you sabotage it for future generations? If you answered "By implementing the worst 2KRO logic known to mankind", you'd be absolutely right! ðŸŽ‰

So after mere *minutes* in research & design, **Bittens Incorporated** proudly presents you a drop-in replacement PCB with countless improvements:
- **NKRO (N-Key Rollover):** How do you do, fellow kids? Y'all like playing video games?
- **Solenoid Support:** Do you love annoying your loved ones... *and yourself?*
- **QMK/Vial:** Just plug in your keyboard, and remap your keys in Vial! ~We know you're too lazy for anything else.~
- **Multi-layout Compatibility:** We almost forgot about you, M0118 owners. *Almost!*

The PCB is a through-hole kit that requires a Raspberry Pi Pico and some diodes for basic functionality, making it a cheap & easy project to complete!

In this chapter, we'll cover the bare minimum to get this PCB up and running. _No frills, no thrills!_

### Prerequisites

|	Q		|	Item			|	Description		|	Importance		|	Example											|
|	------------	|----				|	------------		|	------------		|	------------										|
|	x1		|	Controller		|	RP2040			|	*Mandatory*		|	[Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003928558306.html)		|
|	x81		|	Diodes			|	DO-35			|	*Mandatory*		|	[1N4148](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001126137167.html)				|
|	x40 		|	Bent Pin Headers	|	â€”			|	Recommended		|	[40x Top bending DW](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html)		|


- [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) will be required for verification. Please ensure that it's installed and running correctly.
- M0118 keyboards use an ISO layout, which will need 84 diodes instead. Their locations are denoted by a symbol on the PCB.
- The Bent Pin Headers listed above will make assembly easier, but the [Straight Pin Headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/assemb-straight-header.jpg) included with your Raspberry Pi Pico can still work.
- A decent soldering iron and a pair of sharp wire-cutters are recommended!

## Flashing
This section will cover how you can easily flash your RP2040-based controller. My unit was a cheap clone I bought off of AliExpress.

1. Get the .uf2 firmware file: [Visit the Releases page to download the latest version.](https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/releases/tag/m0116-v2.0.0)

3. Set your Raspberry Pi Pico into Bootloader:
	- Press the **BOOT** and **RST** buttons simultaneously.
<img src='https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/photos/prep-1.jpg ' width='500'>

4. A new device should now be connected to your computer. Open the device directory:
<img src='https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/photos/prep-2.jpg ' width='750'>

5. Drag the .uf2 file into your newly connected device:
	- Your RP2040 controller should **reboot** in a second.
<img src='https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/photos/prep-3.jpg ' width='750'>

<br>

âœ… If you've done everything correctly, **Vial** should now recognize your RP2040 controller as an M0116 keyboard!

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/vial_preview.png ' width='750'>

## Installation
This section will guide you through the process of assembling your PCB. 
_Be prepared for extensive use of your soldering iron and wire-cutter!_

1. Solder the **1N4148** diodes into the PCB:
	- **Direction is important!** Follow the symbol on the PCB.
	- Some diode locations are dedicated only to the M0118 layout!
	- _Tip: To secure the diode in place before soldering, try bending down the legs on the other side!_
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/assemb-1.jpg ' width='500'>

2. Install the Pin Headers onto your RP2040 controller the "incorrect" way:
	- Insert the Pin Headers from the top, rather then from the bottom.
	- This will minimize the final height of your RP2040 controller and avoid clearance issues.
	- **Note 1:** If you're using the [Bent Pin Headers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html) mentioned previously, you will **not** need to solder it in.
	- **Note 2:** If you're using the [Straight Pin Headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/assemb-straight-header.jpg) included with your Raspberry Pi Pico, solder it in, but **keep the solder to a minimum!** (The protruding legs need to be as thin as possible!)

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/assemb-2a.gif ' width='500'>

3. Solder your RP2040 controller onto the PCB:
	- Before soldering, the RP2040 controller must "seat" in all the way.
	- **Note:** If you're using the [Straight Pin Headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/assemb-straight-header.jpg) included with your Raspberry Pi Pico, and the controller doesn't "seat" in all the way, go back to Step 2 and suck out any solder left on the protruding legs.
	- Proceed to solder all the pins.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/placeholder.png ' width='500'>

4. Verify that each switch is triggering reliably:
	- Open **Vial** and check the "Matrix Tester" tab.
	- Short each switch manually using a pair of tweezers. The key should light up in Vial.
	- If a switch doesn't trigger, check the solder joint on the nearby **diode**.
	- If an entire row/column doesn't trigger, check the associated solder joint on the **RP2040 Controller**.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/placeholder.png ' width='500'>

5. **(Optional)** Snip off the protruding pins for a cleaner look:
	- If you're using the [Bent Pin Headers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html) mentioned previously, snip off at the "bend".
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/placeholder.png ' width='500'>

<br>

âœ… Congratulations! Your PCB is now ready for installation!

<br>

# Solenoid (Optional)

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/sol_preview.jpg ' width='1000'>

This chapter will guide you through the process of installing all the components needed for a solenoid! *Let's annoy the entire house!*

### Prerequisites

|	Q		|	Item			|	Description		|	Importance		|	Example									|
|	------------	|----				|	------------		|	------------		|	------------								|
|	x1 		|	MOSFET			|	TIP120			|	*Mandatory*		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006131704396.html)		|
|	x1		|	Diode			|	DO-35			|	*Mandatory*		|	[1N4148](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001126137167.html)		|
|	x1 		|	Capacitor 		|	2.2 â€” 4.7uF		|	Recommended		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000822340335.html)		|
|	x1 		|	Resistor		|	1k â€” 10k Î©		|	Recommended		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32660635741.html)		|
|	x1 		|	Solenoid		|	Any 5V Solenoid		|	Recommended		|	[Example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002278950915.html)		|
|	x2 		|	Bent Pin Headers	|	â€”			|	Optional		|	[40x Top bending DW](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html)|
|	x2 		|	Jumper Cable		|	Female End		|	Optional		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006050213130.html)		|


- [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) will be required for configuration. Please ensure that it's installed and running correctly.
- You _could_ power the solenoid without the Capacitor and Resistor, but over time, this can **potentially damage your RP2040 controller and/or USB Port on your Motherboard.**
- You can solder the solenoid into the PCB directly without the Pin Headers, but this is not recommended.

## Installation
There are 6 independent components to install, but you can install them in any order!

### TIP120
- **Before** installation, bend the 3 protruding pins into a 90Â° angle.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/sol_mosfet.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### 2.2uF â€” 4.7 uF Capacitor
- Ensure you install it correctly. Follow the symbol on the PCB.
- **WARNING:** Incorrect installation could make things go explodey!
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/sol_capacitor.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### 1k â€” 10k Î© Resistor
- Same trick with the diodes. Bend the legs down on the other side to secure it before soldering!
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/sol_resistor.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### DO-35 Diode
- **Direction is important!** Follow the symbol on the PCB.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/sol_diode.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### Male Pin Headers
- We need to connect our solenoid in a **detachable** manner. 
- Any connector would work (ex. JST Plug Connectors), but we can re-use our [Bent Pin Headers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html).
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/sol_pin_header.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### Solenoid Headers
- Same points apply as <a href="#male-pin-headers">previously mentioned.</a>
- Direction doesn't matter. You can reverse the pins and the solenoid should still work.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/sol_header.jpg ' width='350'>

<br>

âœ… Congratulations! You can now configure your solenoid in Vial.
- All the necessary Solenoid Controls are located in **Layer 2** with the [default keymaps](https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/tree/main/bit_m0116/keymaps).

<br>

# Detachable Cable (Optional)
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/socket-preview.jpg ' width='1000'>
At this point, your M0116 PCB is ready to go! However, if you're like to give it that finishing touch, you should wire up a custom connector!

### Prerequisites

|	Q		|	Item		|	Description		|	Importance		|	Example											|
|	------------	|----			|	------------		|	------------		|	------------										|
|	x1 		|	Type-C Socket	|	Detachable Cable Port	|	*Mandatory*		|	[4-Pin](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005565293821.html)				|
|	x1 		|	Type-C Cable	|	Any old cable		|	Optional		|	â€”											|

- The Type-C socket linked above can fit without any modification, but you can still use any socket you like!
- You'll need to chop up a Type-C cable and wire it up correctly, so basic cable-making knowledge is recommended.
## Installation

1. Chop up a Type-C cable, and wire it up correctly to the socket:
	- You're gonna need to use your cable-making knowledge to figure out the pins.
	- Using heatshrinks can make the job look a lot cleaner.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/bit_m0116/socket-example-1.jpg ' width='500'>

2. Secure the socket into the case.
	- To get some leverage, plug in a Type-C cable, hold down the nut in place, and start rotating the socket by the plugged cable.
	- While rotating the housing, the individual wires can twist up. Be sure to occasionally un-twist them while rotating the housing!
