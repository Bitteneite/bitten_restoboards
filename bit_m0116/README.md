Picture this... It's 1987, and you're an engineer tasked with the crucial job of designing a legendary keyboard for Apple's upcoming **Macintosh SE**. How would you sabotage it for future generations? If you answered "By implementing the worst 2KRO logic known to mankind", you'd be absolutely right! 🎉

So after mere *minutes* in research & design, **Bittens Incorporated** proudly presents you a drop-in replacement PCB with countless improvements:
- **NKRO (N-Key Rollover):** How do you do, fellow kids? Y'all like playing video games?
- **Solenoid Support:** Do you love annoying your loved ones... *and yourself?*
- **QMK/Vial:** Just plug in your keyboard, and remap your keys in Vial! ~We know you're too lazy for anything else.~
- **Multi-layout Compatibility:** We almost forgot about you, M0118 owners. *Almost!*

# Assembling your PCB

In this chapter, we'll cover the bare minimum to get this PCB up and running. _No frills, no thrills!_

### Prerequisites

|	Q		|	Item			|	Description		|	Importance		|	Example											|
|	------------	|----				|	------------		|	------------		|	------------										|
|	x1		|	Controller		|	RP2040			|	*Mandatory*		|	[Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003928558306.html)		|
|	x81		|	Diodes			|	DO-35			|	*Mandatory*		|	[1N4148](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001126137167.html)				|
|	x40 		|	Bent Pin Headers	|	—			|	Recommended		|	[40x Top bending DW](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html)		|


- [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) will be required for verification. Please ensure that it's installed and running correctly.
- M0118 keyboards use an ISO layout, which will need 84 diodes instead. Their locations are denoted by a symbol on the PCB.
- The Bent Pin Headers listed above will make assembly easier, but the [Straight Pin Headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/assemb-straight-header.jpg) included with your Raspberry Pi Pico can still work.
- A decent soldering iron and a pair of sharp wire-cutters are recommended!

## Preparing your RP2040 Controller
This section will cover how you can easily flash your RP2040-based controller. My unit was a cheap clone I bought off of AliExpress.

1. Get the .uf2 firmware file: [Visit the Releases page to download the latest version.](https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/releases/tag/m0116-v2.0.0)

2. Set your RP2040 Controller into **Bootloader Mode**:
	- Press the **BOOT** and **RST** buttons simultaneously.
<img src='https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/photos/prep-1.jpg ' width='500'>

3. **Flash** your RP2040 Controller:
	- After going into Bootloader Mode, a new device should be connected to your computer.
	- Open the new directory, and drag the .uf2 file into it.
	- Your RP2040 Controller should **reboot** in a second.

4. Open **Vial** & Verify:
	- If you've done everything correctly, your RP2040 Controller should now be recognized as "Apple Standard Keyboard".

<h6 align="center">✅ Congratulations! The monkey-brain of your M0116 PCB is now firing on all 2 braincells!</h6>

## Installation
This section will guide you through the process of assembling your PCB. 
_Be prepared for extensive use of your soldering iron and wire-cutter!_

1. Solder the **1N4148** diodes into the PCB:
	- **Direction is important!** Follow the symbol on the PCB.
	- Some diode locations are dedicated only to the M0118 layout!
	- _Tip: To secure the diode in place before soldering, try bending down the legs on the other side!_

2. Install the Pin Headers onto your RP2040 controller the "incorrect" way:
	- Insert the Pin Headers from the top, rather then from the bottom.
	- This will minimize the final height of your RP2040 controller and avoid clearance issues.
	- **Note 1:** If you're using [Straight Pin Headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/assemb-straight-header.jpg), go ahead and solder it in, but **keep the solder to a minimum!** (The protruding legs need to be as thin as possible!)
	- **Note 2:** If you're using [Bent Pin Headers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html), you will **not** need to solder it in yet. (You can solder them after Step 3)

3. Solder your RP2040 controller onto the PCB:
	- Before soldering, the RP2040 controller must "seat" in all the way.
	- **Note:** If you're using [Straight Pin Headers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/assemb-straight-header.jpg), and the controller doesn't "seat" in all the way, go back to Step 2 and suck out any solder left on the protruding legs.
	- Proceed to solder all the pins.

4. Verify that each switch is triggering reliably:
	- Open **Vial** and check the "Matrix Tester" tab.
	- Short each switch manually using a pair of tweezers. The key should light up in Vial.
	- If a switch doesn't trigger, check the solder joint on the nearby **diode**.
	- If an entire row/column doesn't trigger, check the associated solder joint on the **RP2040 Controller**.

5. **(Optional)** Snip off the protruding pins for a cleaner look:
	- If you're using [Bent Pin Headers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html), snip off at the "bend".

# Solenoid (Optional)
- Installing a **Solenoid** will require a few extra off-the-shelf parts.
- For instructions, please [visit the README-SOLENOID.md file.](https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/bit_m0116/README-SOLENOID.md)

# Detachable Cable (Optional)
- Installing a **Detachable Cable** is fairly simple, but requires basic cable-making knowledge.
- For instructions, please [visit the README-CABLE.md file.](https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/bit_m0116/README-CABLE.md)
