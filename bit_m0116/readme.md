Picture this... It's 1987, and you're an engineer tasked with the crucial job of designing a legendary keyboard for Apple's upcoming **Macintosh SE**. How would you sabotage it for future generations? If you answered "By implementing the worst 2KRO logic known to mankind", you'd be absolutely right! ðŸŽ‰

So after mere *minutes* in research & design, **Bittens Incorporated** proudly presents you a drop-in replacement PCB with countless improvements:
- **NKRO (N-Key Rollover):** How do you do, fellow kids? Y'all like playing video games?
- **Solenoid Support:** Do you love annoying your loved ones... *and yourself?*
- **QMK/Vial:** Just plug in your keyboard, and remap your keys in Vial! ~We know you're too lazy for anything else.~
- **Multi-layout Compatibility:** We almost forgot about you, M0118 owners. *Almost!*

The PCB is a through-hole kit that requires a Raspberry Pi Pico and some diodes for basic functionality, making it a cheap & easy project to complete!

# Assembling

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/assemb_preview.jpg ' width='1000'>

In this chapter, we'll cover the bare minimum to get this PCB up and running. _No frills, no thrills!_

### Prerequisites

|	Q		|	Item		|	Description		|	Importance		|	Example											|
|	------------	|----			|	------------		|	------------		|	------------										|
|	x1		|	Controller	|	RP2040			|	*Mandatory*		|	[Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003928558306.html)		|
|	x81		|	Diodes		|	DO-35			|	*Mandatory*		|	[1N4148](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001126137167.html)				|
|	x40 		|	Pin Headers	|	â€”			|	Optional		|	[40x Top bending DW](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html)		|


- [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) will be required for verification. Please ensure that it's installed and running correctly.
- M0118 keyboards use an ISO layout, which will need 84 diodes instead. Their location on the PCB is denoted by a symbol.
- The Pin Headers listed above will make assembly easier, but the ones included with your Raspberry Pi Pico can still work.
- A decent soldering iron and a pair of sharp wire-cutters are recommended!

## Flashing
This section will cover how you can easily flash your RP2040-based controller. My unit was a cheap clone I bought off of AliExpress.

1. Download the .uf2 firmware file:

2. Set your Raspberry Pi Pico into Bootloader:
	- Press the BOOT and RST buttons simultaneously.
<img src='https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/photos/prep-1.jpg ' width='500'>

3. A new device should be connected to your computer. Open the device directory:
<img src='https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/photos/prep-2.jpg ' width='750'>

4. Drag the .uf2 file into your newly connected device:
	- Your RP2040 controller should reboot in a second.
<img src='https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/blob/main/photos/prep-3.jpg ' width='750'>

<br>

âœ… If you've done everything correctly, Vial should now recognize your RP2040 controller as an M0116 keyboard!

## Installation
This section will guide you through the process of assembling your PCB. 
_Be prepared for extensive use of your soldering iron and wire-cutter!_

1. Install the 1N4148 diodes into the PCB:
	- **Direction is important!** Follow the symbol on the PCB.
	- Some diode locations are dedicated only to the M0118 layout! You can safely ignore those.
	- _Tip: To secure the diode in place before soldering, try bending down the legs on the other side!_
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/assemb-1.jpg ' width='500'>

2. Install the Pin Headers onto your RP2040 controller the "incorrect" way:
	- This will minimize the height final of your RP2040 controller and avoid clearance issues.
	- Note 1: If you're using the [bent pin headers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html) mentioned previously, you won't need to solder it in.
	- Note 2: If you're using the straight pin headers included with your Raspberry Pi Pico, solder it in, but **keep the solder to a minimum!** (The protruding legs need to be as thin as possible!)
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/placeholder.png ' width='500'>

3. Solder your RP2040 controller onto the PCB:
	- If done correctly, the RP2040 controller should "seat" in all the way.
	- Note: If you're using the straight pin headers included with your Raspberry Pi Pico, and the controller doesn't "seat" in all the way, go back to Step 2 and suck out any solder left on the protruding legs.
	- Proceed to solder all the pins.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/placeholder.png ' width='500'>

4. Verify that each switch is triggering reliably:
	- Open **Vial** and check the "Matrix Tester" tab.
	- Short each switch manually using a pair of tweezers. The key should light up in Vial.
	- If a switch doesn't trigger, check the solder joint on the nearby **diode**.
	- If an entire row/column doesn't trigger, check the solder joint on the **RP2040 Controller**.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/photos/placeholder.png ' width='500'>

5. Once verified, snip off the protruding pins for a cleaner look:
	- If you're using the [bent pin headers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html) mentioned previously, snip off at the "bend".
	- If you're using the straight pin headers included with your Raspberry Pi Pico, snip off the leg as much as you can.

âœ… Congratulations! Your PCB is now ready for installation!

<br>

# Solenoid (Optional)

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/sol_preview.jpg ' width='1000'>

This chapter will guide you through the process of installing all the components needed for a solenoid!
There are six components to install, but you can install them in any order.

### Prerequisites

|	Q		|	Item		|	Description		|	Importance		|	Example									|
|	------------	|----			|	------------		|	------------		|	------------								|
|	x1 		|	MOSFET		|	TIP120			|	*Mandatory*		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006131704396.html)		|
|	x1		|	Diode		|	DO-35			|	*Mandatory*		|	[1N4148](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001126137167.html)		|
|	x1 		|	Capacitor 	|	2.2 â€” 4.7uF		|	Recommended		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000822340335.html)		|
|	x1 		|	Resistor	|	1k â€” 10k Î©		|	Recommended		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32660635741.html)		|
|	x2 		|	Pin Header	|	â€”			|	Optional		|	[40x Top bending DW](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000660389713.html)|
|	x2 		|	Jumper Cable	|	Female End		|	Optional		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006050213130.html)		|


- [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) will be required for configuration. Please ensure that it's installed and running correctly.
- You _could_ power the solenoid without the Capacitor and Resistor, but it will be **much less reliable.**
- You can solder the solenoid into the PCB directly without the Pin Headers, but this is not recommended.

## Installation
### TIP120
- Bend the 3 protruding pins into a 90Â° angle **before** installation.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/sol_mosfet.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### 2.2uF â€” 4.7 uF Capacitor
- Ensure you install it correctly. Follow the symbol on the PCB.
- **WARNING:** Incorrect installation could make things go explodey!
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/sol_capacitor.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### 1k â€” 10k Î© Resistor
- Same trick with the diodes. Bend the legs down on the other side to secure it before soldering!
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/sol_resistor.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### DO-35 Diode
- **Direction is important!** Follow the symbol on the PCB.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/sol_diode.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### Male Pin Headers
- Alternatively, you can use a JST connector or similar.
- You could solder the solenoid into the pins directly, but this is not recommended.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/sol_pin_header.png ' width='350'>

<br>

### Solenoid Headers
- Same points apply as above.
- Direction doesn't matter. You can reverse the pins and the solenoid will still work.
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/sol_header.jpg ' width='350'>

<br>

âœ… Congratulations! You can now configure your solenoid in Vial.
- The [default keymaps](https://github.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/tree/main/bit_m0116/keymaps) have all the necessary controls in **Layer 2**.

<br>

# Detachable Cable (Optional)
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bitteneite/bitten_restoboards/main/bit_m0116/photos/socket-preview.jpg ' width='1000'>
At this point, your M0116 PCB is ready to go! However, if you're like to give it that finishing touch, you should wire up a custom connector!

### Prerequisites

|	Q		|	Item		|	Description		|	Importance		|	Example											|
|	------------	|----			|	------------		|	------------		|	------------										|
|	x1 		|	Type-C Socket	|	Cable Port		|	*Mandatory*		|	[Link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005565293821.html)				|
|	x1 		|	Type-C Cable	|	Any old cable		|	Optional		|	â€”											|

- The Type-C socket I bought fitted without any modification, but you can still use any socket you like!
- You'll need to chop up a Type-C cable and wire it up correctly, so basic cable-making knowledge is recommended.
## Installation
